# Fast Prototyping

## Summary
Fast Prototyping is a 2 part demo consisting of speech and structured data.

## Motivation
This web application was developed to enable evaluations of novel language technologies for improving workflow efficiencies in a hospital telehealth setting.

## Framework Used
The web application was built with React and Flask. 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. 

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that does not require particular tools or libraries.

The design of the web application was made possible with Ant Design, a React UI library that contains a set of high-quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

## Usage of Entire Application
The web application should be launched at [localhost:3000](/) by default.

## Speech Data Component
The following instructions are for the speech data component.

### Features
* Allow users to enter dialogue / transcription of audio files in text format
* Dialogue / transcription will be processed using LSTM model 
* Results of LSTM model will be displayed as a table
* Users can clear dialogue / transcription if needed
* Loading animation shown while waiting for processing to be done
* Allow users to play audio files from a dropdown list
* Allow users to search for a specific word and display the sentence in which the word appears in

* Dataframes will be processed by model
* Results of model will be displayed as a table of risk levels
* Users can clear data entered if needed
* Loading animation shown while waiting for processing to be done
* Allow users to upload files from local directory
* File properties will be displayed
* Highlight most important column based on a dataframe returned by the backend
